# Nexara

### The Intelligent Nexus of Enterprise Wi-Fi Access Control

> **Nexa** — from *Nexus*, the connection point where every user meets the network  
> **-ra** — from *aura*, the invisible field of trust that surrounds every authorized device

**Nexara** is a self-hosted, production-grade 802.1X Wi-Fi access control platform — combining RADIUS authentication, real-time device management, certificate-based identity, and group policy enforcement into a single intelligent control layer between your wireless infrastructure and your users.

## 💡 What is Nexara?

Every Wi-Fi network has a question it must answer for every device that tries to connect:

> ***"Should this device be allowed on the network — and if so, under what rules?"***

**Nexara** is the system that answers that question, at scale, in real time, without a commercial controller.

It sits as an intelligent layer between your wireless access points and your users. When a device connects, Nexara authenticates it via industry-standard 802.1X (using a username/password or a personal certificate), checks whether it has been approved by an administrator, determines which policy group it belongs to, and signals the access point to put it on the right VLAN with the right bandwidth limits — all within milliseconds.

```
A device connects to Wi-Fi
        ↓
Nexara asks: Is this user known? Is the device approved? What group are they in?
        ↓
Access Point receives the answer: VLAN 100 · 50 Mbps · Session 8h
        ↓
User is on the network — with exactly the access they are entitled to
```

### What makes Nexara different from just running FreeRADIUS?

FreeRADIUS is the engine. **Nexara is the car.**

Raw FreeRADIUS requires writing configuration files, manually editing database rows, building your own admin tooling, and integrating your own notification system. Nexara wraps FreeRADIUS with a complete management platform:

| Raw FreeRADIUS | Nexara |
|---|---|
| Edit `.conf` files to add users | Create users in a web dashboard in seconds |
| Write SQL to assign VLAN attributes | Pick a preset: "Guest · VLAN 100 · 10 Mbps · 4h" |
| No device approval workflow | New devices held in a Pending queue with Telegram notifications |
| No certificate management UI | Built-in CA, per-user cert issuance, password-protected `.p12` download |
| No audit trail | Every admin action and RADIUS event logged with actor and timestamp |
| No real-time monitoring | Live dashboard: active sessions, auth trends, NAS health, reject spikes |
| Requires Linux expertise to operate | Runs anywhere Docker runs — one command, full stack |

### Who is Nexara for?

- **IT teams** managing enterprise Wi-Fi for companies, hospitals, schools, or campuses
- **MSPs** running Wi-Fi infrastructure for multiple client sites
- **Security engineers** who need per-device VLAN isolation and certificate-based auth
- **Developers** who want to understand or extend a production-grade 802.1X stack

### The name

**Nexara** = *Nexus* (the connection point — the meeting place of every user and the network) + *-ra* (from *aura*, the invisible field of trust that surrounds every authorized device, just as a Wi-Fi signal invisibly surrounds a space).

Every device that connects through Nexara is not just authenticated — it is *enveloped in a trusted aura*, assigned its identity, and placed exactly where it belongs.

---

## Overview

**Use Nexara when you need to:**
- Authenticate Wi-Fi users with **usernames/passwords (PEAP)** or **certificates (EAP-TLS)**
- Assign **VLANs and bandwidth limits** per user group automatically on connect
- **Approve, reject, or permanently block** devices before they touch the network
- Give users a **self-service portal** to manage their own devices and certificates
- Get **real-time alerts** via Telegram when devices request access or certificates near expiry
- Keep a full **audit trail** of every admin action and RADIUS authentication event
- Run everything **on your own infrastructure** — no cloud dependency, no vendor lock-in

### Key design decisions

- **RadiusPolicyService** is the only writer of `radcheck`, `radreply`, `radgroupcheck`, `radgroupreply`, `radusergroup`, and `nas`. All mutations are transactional with application tables.
- **FreeRADIUS calls the API** via `rlm_rest` on every `authorize` and `post-auth` — no direct DB coupling between FreeRADIUS and the application schema.
- **Platform settings** (CA, Telegram, cert subjects, NAC policy) live in the `platform_settings` table — configurable at runtime from the admin panel without restarting services.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Docker + Docker Compose | v2.20+ |
| Node.js | 20+ |
| pnpm | 9+ |

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-org/radiusops.git
cd radiusops
pnpm install
```

### 1 — Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set **at minimum** these three secrets before starting:

```env
JWT_SECRET=<random 32+ chars>
COOKIE_SECRET=<random 32+ chars>
MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<random 32+ chars>
```

> All other values have safe defaults for local development. See [Configuration](#-configuration) for the full reference.

### 2 — Start the stack

```bash
# Postgres + FreeRADIUS + API + Web (full stack)
# First boot: API entrypoint applies migrations and seeds the admin automatically
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 3 — Open the dashboard

```
http://localhost:8123
```

Default credentials: `asiq` / `@Shik`  
**Change immediately** in Admin → Users → Edit.

Re-seed manually only if needed: `pnpm db:seed`

### 4 — Point your access point

Configure your AP's RADIUS settings:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| RADIUS Server | `<your-server-ip>` |
| Authentication Port | `1812` |
| Accounting Port | `1813` |
| Shared Secret | value of `RADIUS_HOOK_SECRET` in `.env` |

Run `pnpm lab:config` to print exact values for your environment.

## ⚙ Configuration

All configuration lives in `.env`. Runtime settings (Telegram, CA certificate, cert subjects, NAC policy) are stored in the database and configurable from Admin → Settings without a restart.

### Required secrets

```env
# Signs access tokens — change before production (min 32 chars)
JWT_SECRET=

# Signs session cookies — change before production (min 32 chars)
COOKIE_SECRET=

# Encrypts TOTP seeds and PKCS12 passwords — NEVER rotate after first use (min 32 chars)
MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=

# Shared secret between FreeRADIUS and the API hook
RADIUS_HOOK_SECRET=
```

### Database

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://app_user:password@localhost:5433/radius?schema=public
POSTGRES_PORT=5433
```

### FreeRADIUS

```env
# CN for the auto-generated EAP server certificate
RADIUS_CERT_CN=radius.yourdomain.com

# Allow direct MSCHAPv2 (true = useful for testing; false = production default)
ALLOW_DIRECT_MSCHAP=false

# Block unapproved devices (true = recommended for production)
DEVICE_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true

# Enforce RADIUS IP allowlist (configure IPs in Admin → Settings → RADIUS IP Guard)
RADIUS_IP_GUARD_ENABLED=false
```

### CoA (Change of Authorization)

```env
COA_TIMEOUT_MS=2000
COA_DISCONNECT_ON_PASSWORD_CHANGE=true
COA_DISCONNECT_ON_USER_POLICY_CHANGE=true
COA_DISCONNECT_ON_GROUP_POLICY_CHANGE=false
```

### Alert thresholds

```env
# Alert if a NAS stops sending accounting for this many minutes
ALERT_NAS_SILENT_MINUTES=15

# Alert if more than N auth rejections occur in a 5-minute window
ALERT_REJECT_THRESHOLD_5M=20
```

> **Runtime-only settings** (no env var needed):  
> Telegram bot, CA certificate, cert subject fields, NAC quarantine policy → Admin → Settings

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
# 1. Set production values in .env
#    - Strong JWT_SECRET, COOKIE_SECRET, MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY
#    - Real RADIUS_CERT_CN (your public hostname)
#    - DEVICE_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true
#    - NODE_ENV=production

# 2. Deploy
docker compose up -d --build

# 3. Run migrations
docker compose exec api node ./node_modules/prisma/build/index.js migrate deploy

# 4. Seed first admin (first run only)
docker compose exec api node dist/seed.js
```

### Reverse proxy (nginx example)

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name radius.yourdomain.com;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8123;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }

    # SSE — disable buffering
    location /api/v1/events {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_set_header Connection '';
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        chunked_transfer_encoding on;
    }
}
```

### Production checklist

- [ ] Change default admin password immediately after seed
- [ ] Set strong `JWT_SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECRET`, `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32+ random chars each)
- [ ] Set `RADIUS_CERT_CN` to your public hostname
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Set `DEVICE_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true`
- [ ] Enable MFA for admin accounts (Admin → Settings → Security)
- [ ] Upload or generate CA certificate (Admin → Settings → CA Certificate)
- [ ] Configure Telegram bot for device approval notifications (Admin → Settings → Telegram)
- [ ] Enable RADIUS IP Guard for NAS allowlisting (Admin → Settings → RADIUS IP Guard)
- [ ] Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` when served over HTTPS
- [ ] Run `pnpm lab:check` to verify all services are reachable

**Maintainer:** [Md. Asiqur Rahman Khan](https://github.com/asiqur-rahman)

**Architecture invariant:** All writes to `radcheck`, `radreply`, `radgroupcheck`, `radgroupreply`, `radusergroup`, and `nas` **must** go through `RadiusPolicyService` within a Prisma transaction. Direct Prisma writes to these tables outside the service break the single-source-of-truth guarantee.
